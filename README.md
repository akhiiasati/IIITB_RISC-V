## Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) designed for computer processors. Its focus on simplicity and efficiency, labeled "Reduced Instruction Set Computing" (RISC), is reflected in its name. The architecture is adaptable to a wide range of applications, from embedded devices to high-performance computing systems.

The distinctive features of RISC-V include its open-source nature, which allows free access and modification without licensing constraints. Its modular design enables optional extensions to be added, tailoring the architecture to specific needs. Scalability is another key attribute, achieved through privilege levels that cater to different device complexities.

RISC-V exists in several standard configurations, such as RV32 (32-bit) and RV64 (64-bit), accommodating various register and data path sizes. Its extensibility allows for custom instructions, optimizing performance for specific tasks. The RISC-V ecosystem includes tools, compilers, simulators, and hardware designs, driving its adoption in academia and industry.

However, RISC-V also faces challenges, including competition with established architectures like ARM and x86, ensuring compatibility and standardization, and addressing diverse application requirements. Overall, RISC-V's open and adaptable approach positions it as a promising alternative ISA, capable of spurring innovation across processor design domains.
