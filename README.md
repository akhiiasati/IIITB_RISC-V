### From Application Software to Hardware Execution: A Flow Overview

When a C program is intended to run on hardware, it goes through several stages. Initially, it's translated into RISC-V assembly language. Then, this assembly language is converted into binary machine language, which the hardware understands. The link between RISC-V assembly language and the chip's physical layout is established using Hardware Description Language (HDL), closely tied to hardware operations.

To define a RISC specification, the architecture is implemented to facilitate data transfer through registers. This involves transitioning from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the chip layout in an RTL to GDSII flow. This ensures applications operate seamlessly on the hardware.

To make an application function on hardware, it navigates the software system, involving the Operating System (OS), compiler, and assembler. The OS manages I/O and memory, the compiler translates high-level code into hardware-specific instructions (like RISC-V for RISC-V systems), and the assembler converts these into binary machine language. This binary, the bridge between C and hardware, follows the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), establishing a link between software and hardware through binary instructions.

## Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain

Let's condsider the below C program
```bash
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i, sum = 0, n = 9;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        sum += i;
    printf("The sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
    return 0;
}
```

Compilation:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton_O1.o sum1ton.c
```
This command uses the RISC-V architecture-based GCC compiler to compile the C source file sum1ton.c into an object file named sum1ton_O1.o. Here's the breakdown of the flags used:

- -O1: Specifies the optimization level as 1, representing a basic level of optimization.
- -mabi=lp64: Sets the ABI to "Long and Pointer 64-bit," indicating the size of long integers and pointers is 64 bits.
- -march=rv64i: Generates code for the RISC-V ISA with the base integer instruction set.
- -o sum1ton_O1.o: Specifies the output filename as sum1ton_O1.o.

Disassembly:

To view the disassembled code, use the riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump command:
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton_O1.o | less
```
- This command disassembles the compiled object file sum1ton_O1.o using the riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump tool. The -d flag tells objdump to display the disassembled code. The | less part of the command pipes the output of objdump into the less command, which allows you to view the disassembled code interactively.

Execution on Spike Simulator:

```bash
spike pk sum1ton_O1.o
```

- This command uses the spike simulator to execute the compiled program sum1ton_O1.o. The pk argument indicates that you want to run a "proxy kernel" program. In this case, the program sum1ton_O1.o is executed on the simulated RISC-V architecture provided by the Spike simulator.

![Screenshot from 2023-08-20 21-54-46](https://github.com/akhiiasati/Akhil_IIITB/assets/43675821/ae7cdd43-487a-46f0-b272-08bb0d4a9df6)

This series of steps transforms the C code into RISC-V assembly code, compiles it, and then executes it using the Spike simulator, providing insights into how the C program operates in terms of RISC-V instructions. The -O1 optimization level in the compilation can affect the generated assembly code, optimizing it for performance while maintaining the functional behavior of the original C code.


### Debugging with Spike:
```bash
spike -d pk sum1ton_O1.o
```
This command starts the Spike simulator in debug mode (-d) and specifies that the program sum1ton_O1.o should be executed using the proxy kernel (pk).

Setting Breakpoint:
```bash
until pc 0 10184
```
This command sets a breakpoint at address 0x10184. This breakpoint will pause the execution when the program's Program Counter (PC) reaches that specific address.

Inspecting Register:
```bash
reg 0 sp
```
This command inspects the value stored in register a0 (stack pointer) and displays its current value.

Executing Line by Line:
Press "Enter" to execute the program line by line after setting the breakpoint. The program will execute one line at a time, and you can observe the register values and memory changes as the program progresses.

Inspecting Another Register:

```bash
reg 0 a2
```
This command inspects the value stored in register a2 and displays its current value.
![Screenshot from 2023-08-20 22-12-37](https://github.com/akhiiasati/Akhil_IIITB/assets/43675821/addd4d61-1df4-4d74-9841-ad277a035e87)

Using these commands in the Spike simulator, you can step through the program's execution line by line, inspecting register values and memory changes at each step. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding the behavior of the program.

### Ofast Mode in GCC and RISC-V Assembly Compilation

The "Ofast" mode is an optimization level in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) that enables aggressive optimization options to maximize code performance. This mode goes beyond the usual optimization levels and can result in significantly faster code execution, but it might sacrifice some standards compliance or strictness in favor of performance.

Here, we will document the process of compiling a C program named "sum1ton.c" using the "Ofast" mode in the RISC-V architecture using the riscv-gnu-toolchain. The C program presumably calculates the sum of integers from 1 to N. The steps are as follows:

Compile the above C Program in Ofast Mode:

Use the riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc compiler from the RISC-V GNU Toolchain to compile the "sum1ton.c" program in Ofast mode. The -Ofast flag enables aggressive optimization. The -mabi=lp64 flag specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) to use 64-bit long and pointer types. The -march=rv64i flag specifies the target architecture as RISC-V 64-bit integer-only base.

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton_Ofast.o sum1ton.c
```

Disassemble the Compiled Object File:

Use the riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump tool to disassemble the compiled object file "sum1ton_Ofast.o" into human-readable assembly code. The less command is used to view the output one screen at a time.

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton_Ofast.o | less
```

Run the Assembly Code in the RISC-V Spike Simulator:
Use the "spike pk" command to run the compiled object file in the RISC-V Spike simulator. Spike is a functional RISC-V ISA simulator that can execute RISC-V binaries.

```bash
spike pk sum1ton_Ofast.o
```

The above steps summarize the process of compiling the "sum1ton.c" C program in "Ofast" mode using the RISC-V GNU Toolchain and then disassembling and simulating the compiled object file using the RISC-V Spike simulator.

![Screenshot from 2023-08-20 22-18-11](https://github.com/akhiiasati/Akhil_IIITB/assets/43675821/05910d07-007b-473f-8e4d-577d92399e7f)
![Screenshot from 2023-08-20 22-18-36](https://github.com/akhiiasati/Akhil_IIITB/assets/43675821/6bda54df-71c0-463a-8514-57de848aecba)

Note: When compiling the same C code in "Ofast" mode, it utilizes a smaller number of instructions in comparison to the "O1" mode. This discrepancy can be attributed to the "Ofast" mode's heightened level of aggressiveness in optimization, which seeks to extract superior code performance at the potential expense of adhering strictly to language standards or preserving certain code structures. Consequently, the resulting assembly code from "Ofast" mode is streamlined and efficient, accomplishing the same computational task with fewer instructions than the assembly generated under the relatively more conservative "O1" optimization mode.

### Data Representation and Storage in RISC-V

In RISC-V and computer architecture in general, several terms relate to data representation and storage. Let's explore them:

![Screenshot (45)](https://github.com/akhiiasati/IIITB_RISC-V/assets/43675821/b27c8370-7575-4622-9816-fb974851b1eb)

- Byte: A byte is the fundamental unit of data storage and representation in computers. It consists of 8 bits and can represent a single character or value.

- Word: A word typically refers to the natural data size that a processor operates with. In RISC-V, the term "word" can vary based on the architecture. For example, in RV32 (32-bit architecture), a word is 4 bytes (32 bits), while in RV64 (64-bit architecture), a word is 8 bytes (64 bits).

- Double Word: A double word is twice the size of a word. In RISC-V, for example, in RV32, a double word is 8 bytes (64 bits), and in RV64, a double word is 16 bytes (128 bits).

- Least Significant Bit (LSB): The least significant bit is the lowest-order bit in a binary representation.

- Most Significant Bit (MSB): The most significant bit is the highest-order bit in a binary representation. It has the greatest influence on the overall value of a number. The MSB is the bit that represents the largest power of two.

- Endianness: Endianness refers to how multi-byte data is stored in memory. In a big-endian system, the most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address, while in a little-endian system, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address. RISC-V supports both big-endian and little-endian modes.

- Byte Addressing: Byte addressing is a memory addressing scheme used in computer systems to identify and access individual bytes of data within the computer's memory. In byte addressing, each individual byte in the memory has a unique address, allowing direct access to and manipulation of single bytes of data. In RISC-V, like in many other computer architectures, memory is byte-addressable.

- Understanding these terms is crucial when working with data representation, memory allocation, and programming in computer systems, including the RISC-V architecture.

### Representation of Signed and Unsigned Numbers

#### Unsigned Numbers:

Unsigned numbers don't have any sign; they can only contain the magnitude of the number. The representation of unsigned binary numbers consists of all positive numbers. Since there is no sign bit in this representation, an N-bit binary number represents its magnitude only. Zero (0) is also an unsigned number. Every number in unsigned number representation has only one unique binary equivalent form, making it an unambiguous representation technique. The range of unsigned binary numbers is from 0 to ((2^n)-1).

#### Signed Numbers:
Generally, the 2's complement representation is used for signed numbers. The 2â€™s complement of a number is obtained by inverting each bit of the given number and adding 1 to the least significant bit (LSB). Positive numbers are represented in binary form, while negative numbers are represented in 2â€™s complement form. An extra bit is used for sign representation. If the value of the sign bit is 0, the number is positive and can be directly represented in a simple binary form. If the value of the sign bit is 1, the number is negative, and the 2â€™s complement of the given binary number should be taken. In this representation, zero (0) has only one (unique) representation, which is always positive. The range of 2â€™s complement form is from (-2^(n-1)) to ((2^(n-1))-1).

### Exploring Unsigned Number Representation in RISC-V

This section focuses on a C code snippet that demonstrates the concept of unsigned numbers in the RISC-V architecture. The code's purpose is to calculate and illustrate the highest value that an unsigned number can represent within the RV64I instruction set. We provide in-depth explanations and instructions, thoroughly explaining the code's features and functionality:

```bash
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{
    unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,64)-1); //Line 1
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,127)-1);// Line 2
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,64)*-1);// Line 3
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(-2,64)-1);// Line 4
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(-2,63)-1);// Line 5
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,10)-1);// Line 6
    printf("Highest number represented by unsigned long long int is %llu \n", max);
    return 0;
}
```
#### Explanation and Execution:

    %llu: Format specifier for printing a 64-bit unsigned integer.
    %lld: Format specifier for printing a 64-bit signed integer.

By uncommenting different lines in the code, various scenarios are demonstrated along with their outcomes:

    Line 1: Calculates and prints the result of (2^64)-1. This represents the highest value that can be stored in a 64-bit unsigned integer.

    Line 2: While the code attempts to calculate (2^127)-1, it actually yields (2^64)-1 since the maximum value a 64-bit unsigned integer can represent is (2^64)-1.

    Line 3: Calculates and prints the result of 0. This occurs due to the fact that the minimum unsigned value that a 64-bit register can store is 0.

    Line 4: Calculates and prints the result of 0. Similar to Line 3, this result exceeds the representable range for a 64-bit unsigned integer.

    Line 5: Calculates and prints the result of 0. As with Lines 3 and 4, the minimum representable value in a 64-bit unsigned integer is 0.

    Line 6: Calculates and prints the result of 1024. In this case, the value of max is smaller than (2^64)-1.

#### Compiling and Executing the Code:

For compiling and executing the C code using the RISC-V GNU toolchain, follow these steps:
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o unsignedHighest.o unsignedHighest.c
```
Execute the compiled object file using the RISC-V Spike simulator:

    spike pk unsignedHighest.o

![Screenshot from 2023-08-20 22-51-25](https://github.com/akhiiasati/Akhil_IIITB/assets/43675821/bc98fd52-aad8-4f35-a585-b0bce6517c79) 

### Exploring signed Number Representation in RISC-V

This section provides insights into a C code snippet that showcases the behavior of signed numbers within the RV64I instruction set of the RISC-V architecture. The code is designed to determine and demonstrate the maximum and minimum values that can be stored using signed 64-bit integers. The code snippet, along with compilation and execution instructions, is detailed below:

```bash
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{
    long long int max = (long long int)(pow(2,63)-1);
    long long int min = (long long int)(pow(-2,63));
    printf("Highest number represented by long long int is %lld \n", max);
    printf("Smallest number represented by long long int is %lld \n", min);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation and Execution:

By employing the mathematical function pow(), this code determines the maximum and minimum values that a 64-bit signed integer can hold:

    max: This variable calculates and displays the result of (2^63)-1. This represents the highest value that a 64-bit signed integer can represent.

    min: This variable computes and prints the result of -2^63, which is the smallest value that a 64-bit signed integer can represent.

The code then uses printf() to display the calculated values for both the maximum and minimum signed numbers.

#### Compiling and Executing the Code:

For compiling and running the C code using the RISC-V GNU toolchain, follow these steps:

Compile the C code using the RISC-V GCC compiler:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o signedHighest.o signedHighest.c 
```

Run the compiled object file using the RISC-V Spike simulator:

    spike pk signedHighest.o 

#### Output of the Execution:

Upon running the code with the provided instructions, you will see the output that displays the highest and smallest numbers representable by a long long integer in the RV64I architecture.

## Base Integer Instruction Set RV64I

RV64I serves as the base integer instruction set for the 64-bit architecture, building upon the RV32I variant.

### General-Purpose Registers and Operand Types

RV64I employs 31 general-purpose registers, x1â€“x31, to hold integer values. x0 is fixed as the constant 0. Unlike some architectures, there is no hardwired link register for subroutine returns; instead, x1 is commonly used to store return addresses. For RV32, registers are 32 bits wide, while for RV64, they are 64 bits wide. The term XLEN is used to denote the current width of an x register in bits (either 32 or 64).

| Register   | Description                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `x0`       | Hardwired to constant 0.                          |
| `x1`       | Often used for return addresses in subroutine calls. |
| `x2` to `x31` | General-purpose registers holding integer values. |


### Instruction Formats and Types

In the RISC-V instruction set architecture, instructions are categorized into different formats based on their opcode and operand types. Each format is denoted by a single-letter abbreviation. Here's an explanation of each type:

- R-Type (Register Type): These instructions perform operations on two source registers and store the result in a destination register. They cover arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operations. The format is: opcode rd, rs1, rs2.

- I-Type (Immediate Type): These instructions involve an immediate (constant) value as an operand. They work with a source register to perform operations like arithmetic, logical, and memory operations. The format is: opcode rd, rs1, imm.

- S-Type (Store Type): S-type instructions are used for storing data into memory. They combine a source register, a destination address (base register), and an immediate offset to determine where the data should be stored. The format is: opcode rs2, imm(rs1).

- B-Type (Branch Type): B-type instructions are used for conditional branching. They compare values from two source registers and use an immediate offset to determine the branching target. These instructions support operations like equality, inequality, and comparison. The format is: opcode rs1, rs2, imm.

- U-Type (Upper Immediate Type): U-type instructions are for loading immediate values into registers, including unconditional jump instructions. They operate on a single source register and use an immediate value to specify the upper bits of the result. The format is: opcode rd, imm.

- J-Type (Jump Type): J-type instructions are used for unconditional jumps. They involve using an immediate offset to determine the target address of the jump. These instructions are typically used for implementing function calls and other control flow changes. The format is: opcode rd, imm.

![Summary+of+RISC-V+Instruction+Formats](https://github.com/akhiiasati/IIITB_RISC-V/assets/43675821/7e0129e9-2102-4d91-9935-0dc1e39fc0e6)

## Application Binary Interface (ABI) in RISC-V:

### Introduction
The Application Binary Interface (ABI), also referred to as the System Call Interface, allows application programmers to directly access the registers of the RISC-V architecture through system calls. This mechanism enables programmers to interact with hardware resources via registers, facilitated by the ABI. The RISC-V ABI defines standardized functions for registers, promoting software interoperability.

The ABI consists of two primary components: the set of user instructions and the system call interface through the operating system layer.

The RISC-V architecture comprises 32 registers, labeled from x(0) to x(31), with their width determined by XLEN (32 bits for RV32 and 64 bits for RV64). Application programmers can access each of these registers using their ABI names.

![ABI](https://github.com/akhiiasati/IIITB_RISC-V/assets/43675821/f837dc3a-9290-4fa2-91f0-81f9ca69f0f8)

#### Key Points about ABI in RISC-V:

- The RISC-V architecture employs byte-addressable memory.
- RISC-V follows the little-endian memory addressing system.
- Loading data into registers can be done directly or via memory access.
- Direct loading into registers is limited by the number of available registers, necessitating the use of memory for larger data sets.
- Understanding the ABI in RISC-V is crucial for developers working with the architecture, as it provides a standardized approach for interacting with registers and hardware resources.

#### Register File

RISC-V Architecture includes a register file with a total of 32 integer registers and 32 floating-point registers. These registers have specific designated purposes based on their ABI names. The naming convention is crucial for managing these registers efficiently within the architecture. Here are some key points regarding register usage:

Registers starting with 't' (e.g., t0, t1, t2, ..., t6) are temporary registers and can be employed for various purposes as needed.

Registers beginning with 'a' (e.g., a0, a1, ..., a7) serve as argument registers for passing arguments to functions.

Registers that have names starting with 's' (excluding 'sp') are saved registers. They are preserved across function calls and their values are maintained.

<img width="267" alt="regfile" src="https://github.com/akhiiasati/IIITB_RISC-V/assets/43675821/a4319fc5-296c-40ca-b14f-95c289aa4770">

#### Types of Instructions
RISC-V architecture encompasses diverse types of instructions, each designed to operate on different types of data. Among them, Base Integer Instructions are prominent. These instructions facilitate operations on both signed and unsigned integer numbers. Some noteworthy points regarding these instructions are as follows:

There exist around 47 distinct types of Base Integer Instructions in the RISC-V architecture.

Some common categories of Base Integer Instructions are R-type, I-type, and S-type instructions, each having specific functionalities.

R-type Instructions: These instructions exclusively work with registers. For instance: add x8, x24, x8 performs addition using registers.

I-type Instructions: These instructions operate on both registers and immediate values. For example: ld x8, 16(x32) loads data from memory using an immediate offset.

S-type Instructions: These instructions operate on source registers and immediate values and are often used for storing data. For example: sd x8, 8(x23) stores data in memory using an immediate offset.

![MUKIE](https://github.com/akhiiasati/IIITB_RISC-V/assets/43675821/a82a2136-5452-45a1-8725-c4e138d06de1)

#### Register Accessibility and Representation
In the RISC-V architecture, the registers accessed by R-type, I-type, or S-type Instructions are limited to 5 bits. Consequently, the total number of representable registers is 2^5 = 32. As a result, there are 32 registers available (from x0 to x31) in the RISC-V architecture. Proper management of these registers through different instruction formats ensures efficient and effective execution of programs.

## Labwork

### Labwork Using ABI Function Calls

Consider the following example involving C and assembly code:

```bash
#include <stdio.h>

extern int load(int x, int y);

int main()
{
    int result = 0;
    int count = 9;
    result = load(0x0, count + 1);
    printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", count, result);
}
```

#### Assembly Code (ASM)

```bash
.section .text
.global load
.type load, @function

load:
	add 	a4, a0, zero //Initialize sum register a4 with 0x0
	add 	a2, a0, a1   // store count of 10 in register a2. Register a1 is loaded with 0xa (decimal 10) from main program
	add	a3, a0, zero // initialize intermediate sum register a3 by 0
loop:	add 	a4, a3, a4   // Incremental addition
	addi 	a3, a3, 1    // Increment intermediate register by 1	
	blt 	a3, a2, loop // If a3 is less than a2, branch to label named <loop>
	add	a0, a4, zero // Store final result to register a0 so that it can be read by main program
	ret
```

In this example, the C code interacts with the assembly code via the load function. The flowchart of the function performed by the assembly code is illustrated visually.

The ABI enables the C code to pass values to the assembly code through the load function. The assembly code executes the function, returns the result to the C code, and the C code displays the value.

#### Steps to Perform the Lab Task:

Compile the C and assembly code using riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc with optimization, ABI, and architecture flags:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1to9_custom.o 1to9_custom.c load.S
```
Disassemble the compiled object file using riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump and view the output using less:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d 1to9_custom.o | less
```
Run the compiled code using the Spike RISC-V simulator:
```bash
spike pk 1to9_custom.o
```

#### Outputs of the Lab

Flow Chart and ABI Illustration
The flow chart below represents the sequence of operations performed by the assembly code within the load function:

### ASM Flow Chart

This flow chart is crucial in understanding how the assembly code iterates and accumulates the sum of numbers, demonstrating the algorithm's execution visually.

#### ABI Interaction

The provided C code serves as the conduit through which the Application Binary Interface (ABI) principles are demonstrated. The interaction unfolds as follows:

- The C code initializes the count and result variables to appropriate values.
- It invokes the load function from the assembly code, passing the arguments 0x0 and count + 1.
- The assembly code executes the load function, performing the summation operation using the provided algorithm.
- Upon completion, the assembly code returns the computed result via the ABI mechanism to the calling C code.
- Back in the C code, the returned value is captured and then displayed using the printf function.
- This interaction elegantly showcases how the ABI enables seamless communication between different parts of the codebase, allowing the C code to utilize the assembly routine for computation and receive the results effectively.

The combined effect of the flow chart and the ABI interaction demonstration provides a comprehensive understanding of how the given C and assembly code work together to achieve their desired functionality.

## Logic Gates

Logic gates are fundamental components of digital electronic circuits, serving as the building blocks for logical operations. These gates process input signals and generate output signals based on predefined logic rules. By manipulating binary signals, typically represented as "0" and "1," logic gates enable complex digital systems such as processors, memory units, and controllers. They function by performing logical operations and are designed to work with discrete voltage levels representing binary values.

Here are some common types of logic gates:

![Screenshot (62)](https://github.com/RISCV-MYTH-WORKSHOP/RISC-V-CPU-Core-using-TL-Verilog/assets/43675821/b199aeef-e660-49da-981d-a8d0aa6aa048)

These gates can be combined to create intricate digital circuits. Notably, NAND and NOR gates are referred to as universal gates because they can be used to construct all other logic gates. The Verilog representation of logic gates is shown below:

![Screenshot (68)](https://github.com/RISCV-MYTH-WORKSHOP/RISC-V-CPU-Core-using-TL-Verilog/assets/43675821/f9fd4caf-434e-44e3-a1c7-eee94f816eb4)

Multiplexer Using Ternary Operator
A multiplexer is a crucial component for selecting one of multiple input signals and forwarding it as the output. In Verilog, a simple 2:1 multiplexer can be realized using the ternary operator as shown below:

```bash
assign f = s ? x1 : x0;
```
Here, the output f follows x1 when s is 1; otherwise, it follows x0. The corresponding hardware and logic gate representation is illustrated:

![Screenshot (70)](https://github.com/RISCV-MYTH-WORKSHOP/RISC-V-CPU-Core-using-TL-Verilog/assets/43675821/ec47ff05-e330-4add-8da1-9f7b544677f4)

For more complex scenarios, higher bit multiplexers can be created using the conditional operator. Consider the Verilog code for a 4:1 multiplexer below:

```bash
assign f = sel[0] ? a : (sel[1] ? b : (sel[2] ? c : d));
```
In this code, input a holds the highest priority, and input d holds the lowest. This code doesn't create a single 4:1 multiplexer; instead, it forms a series of interconnected 2:1 multiplexers. Here, the sel signal is a one-hot vector, with only one bit set to high at a time. The hardware realization of this concept is depicted below:

![Screenshot (74)](https://github.com/RISCV-MYTH-WORKSHOP/RISC-V-CPU-Core-using-TL-Verilog/assets/43675821/1307f539-2b65-43b8-ae26-cb357e6a8762)

## Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog): An Overview

### Overview:

Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) is an emerging extension to SystemVerilog, offering a new design methodology known as transaction-level design. This approach simplifies the design process by introducing concepts that focus on transactions and abstracting away lower-level hardware details. In this project, TL-Verilog has been chosen as the Hardware Description Language (HDL) of choice, enabling the complete design of projects using this innovative approach.

### TL-Verilog Advantages:

- Simpler Syntax: TL-Verilog introduces a more intuitive and concise syntax, streamlining the design process.
- Shorter Codes: TL-Verilog enables the creation of shorter and more readable code, enhancing productivity.
- Easy Pipelining: The language inherently supports easy pipelining of designs, simplifying complex data processing.
- Timing Abstract: TL-Verilog allows for timing abstraction, enabling specification of pipelines where tools generate sequential elements from the pipelined specification.

### TL-Verilog vs. SystemVerilog: A Comparison

Consider the following comparison between a design written in TL-Verilog and SystemVerilog:

#### TL-Verilog Example:

```tl
// Example TL-Verilog code
pipeline pipe {
    input a, b, c;
    output x, y, z;
    
    stage A { x = a + b; }
    stage B { y = x + c; }
    stage C { z = y * x; }
}
```
#### SystemVerilog Example:

```systemverilog
// Equivalent SystemVerilog code
module pipeline (
    input a, b, c,
    output x, y, z
);
    reg [31:0] x_reg, y_reg, z_reg;
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        x_reg <= a + b;
        y_reg <= x_reg + c;
        z_reg <= y_reg * x_reg;
    end
endmodule
```
### Timing Abstract in TL-Verilog

One notable feature of TL-Verilog is its support for timing abstraction. This feature is particularly useful in designing pipelines where sequential elements are generated by tools based on the pipelined specification. Timing abstraction allows for easy retiming without the risk of introducing functional bugs. For further information on timing abstract in TL-Verilog, refer to the IEEE paper "Timing-Abstract Circuit Design in Transaction-Level Verilog" by Steven Hoover.

#### TL-Verilog Code

The TL-Verilog code for the Combinational Calculator is shown below:

```tl
$reset = *reset;
$op[1:0] = $random[1:0];

$val1[31:0] = $rand1[3:0];
$val2[31:0] = $rand2[3:0];
$sum[31:0] = $val1 + $val2;
$diff[31:0] = $val1 - $val2;
$prod[31:0] = $val1 * $val2;
$div[31:0] = $val1 / $val2;

$out[31:0] = $op[1] ? ($op[0] ? $div : $prod) : ($op[0] ? $diff : $sum);
```
#### Function Table

The function table for the Combinational Calculator is provided below:

| Opcode | Function         |
|--------|------------------|
| 2'b00  | Addition         |
| 2'b01  | Subtraction      |
| 2'b10  | Multiplication   |
| 2'b11  | Division         |


#### How it Works

- The calculator receives a reset signal (*reset) to initialize the calculations.
- A 2-bit opcode ($op[1:0]) is randomly generated, determining the arithmetic operation to be performed.
- Two 4-bit random values ($rand1[3:0] and $rand2[3:0]) are generated as operands.
- The calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on the operands.
- Based on the opcode, the output ($out[31:0]) is determined by selecting the appropriate result.

## Sequential Circuits

Sequential circuits are a fundamental aspect of digital electronics, incorporating memory elements to retain and process information over time. Unlike combinational circuits, sequential circuits have feedback loops, enabling them to store past inputs and exhibit dynamic behavior. These circuits are essential for tasks requiring memory and timing, such as memory units, flip-flops, and state machines. In sequential circuits, outputs depend on both current inputs and the internal state, making them crucial for various applications, including counters, shift registers, and complex control systems.

## Pipelining

Pipelining is a fundamental technique in computer architecture and digital system design aimed at improving the efficiency of processing complex tasks. It accomplishes this by dividing a large task into smaller, sequential stages and executing these stages concurrently. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data, and these stages are organized in a pipeline, where each stage hands off its results to the next stage without waiting for the entire task to complete. This allows multiple instructions or tasks to be in different stages of execution simultaneously, effectively increasing the throughput of the system.

In a pipelined architecture, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages, such as instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back. Each instruction moves from one stage to the next on every clock cycle, allowing multiple instructions to overlap in execution. This minimizes idle time in the processor and reduces the overall time required to complete a sequence of tasks.

### Identifiers and Types in TL-Verilog

Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) follows specific rules for naming identifiers, which play a significant role in the design and description of digital systems.

![Screenshot 2023-08-22 214432](https://github.com/akhiiasati/IIITB_RISC-V/assets/43675821/691d2e89-037e-4d7d-a565-c577be2e7f7e)

- $lower_case: This naming convention is used for pipe signals. Pipe signals represent data that flows through different pipeline stages. They are typically used to connect the output of one stage to the input of the next stage.

- $CamelCase: State signals are represented using this convention. State signals define the state or status of a component in the system. They are often used to control the behavior and transitions of the digital design.

- $Upper_CASE: Keyword signals use uppercase naming. Keyword signals are reserved for specific purposes within the design and are often used for control or synchronization purposes.
 

Identifiers can include numbers at the end of tokens, such as $base64_value, as long as they adhere to the naming conventions specified above.

### Basic Pipelined Circuits

#### Pipelined Pythagorean:

The provided TL-Verilog code demonstrates the concept of pipelining through the example of calculating the square root of the sum of squares of two numbers, often known as the Pythagorean theorem. The code defines a pipeline with several stages denoted by |calc @n, where n represents the stage number. Each stage performs a specific operation in the calculation of the Pythagorean theorem. The input values are squared, their squares are summed, and the square root of the sum is calculated.

## Validity

### Brief Introduction:

In Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog), validity is a crucial concept used to manage the state and timing of transactions within a design description. Transactions represent higher-level actions or events that take place within a design. A transaction encompasses a collection of signals that encode both data and control information related to a specific action. Validity refers to whether a transaction is considered "valid" or "invalid," and this status is determined based on the state of the associated signals.

In TL-Verilog, validity is an essential mechanism for tracking the progression of transactions through various stages of a design. Transactions are often used to model operations that span multiple clock cycles or involve multiple components working together. The concept of validity helps to synchronize the flow of data and control information between different parts of the design, ensuring that actions are executed in the correct sequence and that data dependencies are properly managed.

The validity of a transaction is controlled by specific signals that indicate whether the data and control information within that transaction are meaningful and should be considered for processing. For example, a "valid" signal might be asserted to indicate that the data within a transaction is legitimate and ready for processing. Conversely, an "invalid" signal might indicate that the transaction is not yet ready or that the data is not valid.

Using validity signals, designers can create robust and well-coordinated designs that accurately reflect the intended behavior of the system being modeled.

### Clock Gating:

Clock gating is a power-saving technique employed in digital circuit design to reduce power consumption by managing the distribution of the clock signal to specific circuit blocks. The primary objective of clock gating is to minimize unnecessary clock transitions in portions of a circuit that are not actively performing computations or tasks. By doing so, clock gating helps to conserve energy in digital systems.

In a digital circuit, the clock signal is fundamental for synchronizing the activities of various components. However, not all components within a system need to be active and consuming power during every clock cycle. Many components spend a considerable amount of time in low-power or idle states. Clock gating capitalizes on this characteristic by selectively enabling or disabling the clock signal to specific parts of the circuit based on their activity status.

The fundamental idea behind clock gating involves inserting a logic gate, often an AND gate, in the path of the clock signal. This gate is controlled by a signal referred to as the "clock enable" signal or "gating signal." When the gating signal is active (high), the gate allows the clock signal to pass through to the associated circuitry. Conversely, when the gating signal is inactive (low), the gate blocks the clock signal, preventing unnecessary clock transitions.

By using clock gating, designers can significantly reduce power consumption in digital systems, especially in scenarios where certain components or blocks of the circuit spend a considerable amount of time in idle states. This technique is a crucial aspect of modern digital design, where power efficiency is a key consideration in many applications.

         $tot_dist[31:0] = $reset ? '0 : ($valid ? (>>1$tot_dist + $out) : $RETAIN);
```

In this example, the distance accumulator accumulates the results of calculations of square roots. The $valid signal indicates whether the data within the transaction is valid. When $valid is asserted, the calculated result ($out) is added to the total distance accumulator ($tot_dist). If $valid is not asserted, the previous value of $tot_dist is retained.

#### TL-Verilog Code:

```tlv
$reset = *reset;
|calc
  @1
     $valid = $reset ? 0 : >>1$valid+1;
     $valid_or_reset = $valid || $reset;
  ?$valid_or_reset
     @1
        $val1[31:0] = >>2$out;
        $sum[31:0] = $val1+$val2;
        $diff[31:0] = $val1-$val2;
        $prod[31:0] = $val1*$val2;
        $div[31:0] = $val1/$val2;
        $valid = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$valid + 1);
     @2
        $out[31:0] = $reset  ? 32'h0 : ($op[1] ? ($op[0] ? $div : $prod):($op[0] ? $diff : $sum));
```

In this example, a 2-cycle calculator is designed with validity tracking. The $valid signal is incremented as each new transaction arrives. The $valid_or_reset signal is used to determine whether the current operation is valid or if a reset condition is active. Depending on this, the calculator processes the input values and generates the output result.

#### TL-Verilog Code:

```tlv
|calc
  @0
     $reset = *reset;

  @1
     $val1 [31:0] = >>2$out;
     $val2 [31:0] = $rand2[3:0];

     $valid = $reset ? 1'b0 : >>1$valid + 1'b1 ;
     $valid_or_reset = $valid || $reset;

  ?$valid_or_reset
     @1   
        $sum [31:0] = $val1 + $val2;
        $diff[31:0] = $val1 - $val2;
        $prod[31:0] = $val1 * $val2;
        $div[31:0] = $val1 / $val2;

     @2   
        $mem[31:0] = $reset ? 32'b0 :
                     ($op[2:0] == 3'b101) ? $val1 : >>2$mem ;

        $out [31:0] = $reset ? 32'b0 :
                      ($op[2:0] == 3'b000) ? $sum :
                      ($op[2:0] == 3'b001) ? $diff :
                      ($op[2:0] == 3'b010) ? $prod :
                      ($op[2:0] == 3'b011) ? $quot :
                      ($op[2:0] == 3'b100) ? >>2$mem : >>2$out ;
```

In this example, a calculator with a single-value memory is demonstrated. Validity is tracked using the $valid signal. Depending on the validity status, various arithmetic operations are performed, and the results are stored in memory. The validity status is also used to decide whether to retrieve values from memory or calculate them based on the specified operation.

These examples showcase how validity is utilized to control the flow of transactions and ensure accurate processing of data within a TL-Verilog design.

# Day 4: Building a RISC-V CPU Core Micro-architecture

In the process of building a RISC-V CPU core micro-architecture, you'll be designing and assembling various components to create a functional CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Here's an overview of the basic components and their functions:

1. Program Counter (PC):
The program counter is a special register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed. It is incremented as instructions are fetched and provides the address to the instruction memory for fetching the next instruction in the program.

2. Instruction Decoder:
The instruction decoder is a crucial circuit that interprets the machine instructions fetched from memory. It decodes the binary representation of the instruction and generates control signals that direct the operation of other components in the CPU to execute the instruction.

3. Instruction Memory:
The instruction memory is a storage component that holds the machine instructions of a program. It's typically read-only and stores binary instructions that the CPU fetches and decodes. The program counter provides the address to the instruction memory for fetching the next instruction.

4. Data Memory:
The data memory is another storage component used to store data manipulated by instructions during program execution. Unlike instruction memory, data memory can be both read from and written to. It holds variables, data arrays, and other information used during program execution.

5. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
The ALU is a fundamental digital circuit within the CPU responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on data. It can execute tasks such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), and comparisons. The ALU generates results used in various computations as specified by the instructions.

6. Read Register File:
The read register file stores a set of registers that hold data during instruction execution. Instructions often involve reading data from these registers. The instruction specifies which registers to read, and the data from these registers can serve as operands for operations performed by the ALU or other components.

7. Write Register File:
The write register file stores the results of operations back into registers. After an instruction is executed, the result is often written back to the register file. This ensures that updated data is available for subsequent instructions.

These components work collaboratively to execute machine instructions in a CPU. The program counter guides the instruction fetch process, the instruction decoder interprets instructions, the ALU performs computations, the register files hold data, and the memory components offer data storage and access. This orchestration enables a CPU to carry out the tasks specified by a program's instructions.

## Program Counter (PC)

### Explanation of the code:

The $rf_wr_en, $rf_wr_index, and $rf_wr_data signals are used for writing data to the register file. In this stage (Register File Read), the write enable signal is set to 0, indicating that no write operation is being performed in this stage.

$rf_rd_en1 and $rf_rd_index1 are used to read data from the register file for the first source register ($rs1), if it is valid (i.e., required by the instruction). The $rs1 index specifies which register's data needs to be read.

Similarly, $rf_rd_en2 and $rf_rd_index2 are used to read data from the register file for the second source register ($rs2), if it is valid (i.e., required by the instruction). The $rs2 index specifies which register's data needs to be read.

The $src1_value and $src2_value signals store the values read from the register file for the first and second source registers, respectively. These values will be used in subsequent stages of the pipeline to perform computations based on the instruction type.

Pipelining is a technique used to improve the performance of processors by dividing the execution of instructions into multiple stages. However, pipelining introduces certain challenges known as hazards, which are situations that can disrupt the smooth execution of instructions. One of the most significant hazards is the "branch instruction hazard," often referred to as the "branch penalty."

1. Structural Hazard:
   
A structural hazard arises when there's a resource conflict in the pipeline. For example, a branch instruction might need to access the same execution unit or memory stage that another instruction already in the pipeline is using. This conflict causes a pipeline stall, during which the resources are reallocated or the conflict is resolved. Structural hazards can cause inefficiencies and degrade performance by delaying instruction execution.

3. Data Hazard:
   
Data hazards occur when instructions depend on the results of previous instructions, and the required data is not yet available. In the context of branch instructions, data hazards can arise when instructions following a branch instruction depend on the outcome of that branch, but the actual decision of whether the branch is taken or not is not yet determined. This can lead to incorrect results if not properly managed. Data hazards must be resolved through techniques like forwarding or stalling, which ensure that instructions receive the correct data for proper execution.

5. Control Hazard (Branch Hazard):
   
Control hazards are the primary concern when dealing with branch instructions in pipelining. They occur due to the uncertainty of whether a branch will be taken or not taken. In a pipelined processor, instructions are fetched ahead of time to maintain pipeline throughput, but the actual outcome of a branch might not be known until it reaches the execution stage. If the branch decision differs from the prediction made during the fetch stage, instructions fetched after the branch can be incorrect.

To handle control hazards, modern processors use branch prediction techniques to make educated guesses about whether a branch will be taken or not. If the prediction is correct, the pipeline proceeds without issues. However, if the prediction is incorrect, a process called "pipeline flushing" is required. Pipeline flushing involves discarding all instructions fetched after the mispredicted branch, effectively resetting the pipeline to the correct instruction sequence. This flushing process incurs a performance penalty, known as the "branch penalty," as it causes wasted work and pipeline stalls.

Overall, branch instructions introduce hazards in pipelining due to the need to make decisions about instruction sequencing, resource allocation, and data dependencies. Managing these hazards effectively through techniques like branch prediction and pipeline flushing is crucial for maintaining pipeline efficiency and improving processor performance.

## Waterfall Logic Diagram for Control Flow Hazard:

In a waterfall logic diagram for a control flow hazard, you would represent each stage of the pipeline vertically, from left to right. The diagram would show the progression of instructions through the pipeline stages. When a control flow hazard occurs, you would see a "bubble" or "stall" in the pipeline stages after the branch instruction.

Here's a simplified example of a waterfall logic diagram showing a control flow hazard:

```sql
   IF    ID    EX    MEM   WB
   ----------------------------
1: ADD   SUB   MUL   ADD   SUB
2:       BEQ   ADD   SUB   MUL   // Control flow hazard
3:             SUB   MUL   ADD
4:                   BEQ   ADD
5:                         SUB
```

In the above diagram:

- Instructions 1 and 2 are progressing normally through the pipeline.
- At stage 2, there's a branch instruction (BEQ) that depends on the result of the previous instruction (SUB in stage 1).
- In stage 3, the branch condition is evaluated and the pipeline realizes there's a branch. However, it's too late to prevent the MUL instruction in stage 2 from entering the pipeline.
- As a result, there's a bubble in stage 3 where no useful work is being done, allowing the pipeline to resolve the branch and fetch the correct instruction (SUB) after the branch.

### Valid signal for Pipelined Logic

The TL-Verilog code to introduce valid signal for pipelined logic is given below :

```tlv
	      $start = >>1$reset && !$reset;
         $valid = $reset ? 1'b0 : ($start || >>3$valid);
         $valid_or_reset = $valid || $reset;
         $rs1_or_funct3_valid    = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         $rs2_valid              = $is_r_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         $rd_valid               = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_u_instr || $is_j_instr;
         $funct7_valid           = $is_r_instr;  
```

In this code:

- $start is a signal that indicates the beginning of pipeline execution. It is set to 1 when there's a rising edge of $reset (indicating a reset cycle) and when the reset signal deactivates (!$reset).
- $valid is a signal that determines whether the current instruction is valid for execution. During a reset cycle ($reset), $valid is set to 1'b0.
- Otherwise, it is set to 1 if either $start is active or the $valid signal from three cycles ago (>>3$valid) is active. This accounts for the pipeline stages and ensures that instructions progress through the pipeline properly.
- $valid_or_reset combines the $valid signal and the $reset signal using a logical OR operation. It helps in determining whether the current instruction is valid for execution, even during a reset.
- The validity signals like $rs1_or_funct3_valid, $rs2_valid, $rd_valid, and $funct7_valid are used to handle various instruction types within the pipeline. For example, $rs1_or_funct3_valid is active for instructions that either require $rs1 or involve $funct3, which includes R, I, S, and B-type instructions. Similarly, $rs2_valid is active for R, S, and B-type instructions, indicating that they require a valid $rs2 operand.

Handling Data Hazards in Register File with Bypassing

```tlv
//Register file bypass logic - data forwarding from ALU to resolve RAW dependence
         $src1_value[31:0] = $rs1_bypass ? >>1$result[31:0] : $rf_rd_data1[31:0];
         $src2_value[31:0] = $rs2_bypass ? >>1$result[31:0] : $rf_rd_data2[31:0];
```
In this code:

- The $rs1_bypass and $rs2_bypass signals indicate whether bypassing is needed to resolve a Read-After-Write (RAW) data hazard. A RAW hazard occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that hasn't completed yet. Bypassing allows forwarding the result from the execution stage directly to the current instruction to avoid stalls due to dependencies.
- $src1_value[31:0] is assigned based on whether $rs1_bypass is active. If bypassing is needed ($rs1_bypass is true), the value of the ALU result from the previous cycle (>>1$result[31:0]) is used. Otherwise, the regular register file read data ($rf_rd_data1[31:0]) is used as the source value for the current instruction's $src1_value.
- $src2_value[31:0] is assigned similarly to $src1_value[31:0], but it depends on the need for $rs2_bypass. If bypassing is needed ($rs2_bypass is true), the ALU result from the previous cycle (>>1$result[31:0]) is used. Otherwise, the regular register file read data ($rf_rd_data2[31:0]) is used as the source value for the current instruction's $src2_value.

### Correcting branch target path

```tlv
// Correcting branch target path

// Current instruction is valid if one of the previous 2 instructions were not (taken_branch or load or jump)
$valid = ~(>>1$valid_taken_br || >>2$valid_taken_br || >>1$is_load || >>2$is_load || >>2$jump_valid || >>1$jump_valid);

// Current instruction is valid & is a taken branch
$valid_taken_br = $valid && $taken_br;

// Current instruction is valid & is a load
$valid_load = $valid && $is_load;

// Current instruction is valid & is jump
$jump_valid = $valid && $is_jump;
$jal_valid  = $valid && $is_jal;
$jalr_valid = $valid && $is_jalr;

*passed = |cpu/xreg[17]>>5$value == (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9);
```

In this code:

The $valid signal determines whether the current instruction is valid for execution based on certain conditions. Specifically, the instruction is considered valid if any of the following conditions are met:

- The previous instruction was not a taken branch ($valid_taken_br from one or two cycles ago).
- The previous instruction was not a load ($is_load from one or two cycles ago).
- The instruction before the previous one was a load ($is_load from two cycles ago).
- The instruction before the previous one was a jump ($is_jump from two cycles ago).
- The previous instruction was a jump ($is_jump from one cycle ago).
- This logic helps prevent incorrect instructions from being executed when there's a taken branch, load instruction, or jump instruction in the pipeline.
- The $valid_taken_br signal indicates whether the current instruction is valid and represents a taken branch instruction.
- The $valid_load signal indicates whether the current instruction is valid and represents a load instruction.
- The $jump_valid, $jal_valid, and $jalr_valid signals indicate whether the current instruction is valid and represents jump, jal (jump and link), and jalr (jump and link register) instructions, respectively.
- The *passed statement is used to determine whether the program execution is successful. It checks if the value in register xreg[17] right-shifted by 5 bits (>>5) equals the sum of the numbers 1 through 9 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9). If this condition is met, the simulation is considered successful.
