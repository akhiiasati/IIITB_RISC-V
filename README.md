## Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is akin to the blueprint of a computer's brain. It serves as the vital link between software and hardware, elucidating both the processor's capabilities and the procedural steps required for task execution. Programmers using assembly language, compilers, and applications frequently refer to the ISA. It encompasses diverse elements such as the types of data the computer can process, specialized storage units known as registers, memory management, significant features like virtual memory, the array of functions a miniature internal computer within the processor can perform, and the methods of communication with external devices. The ISA has the capacity to expand by accommodating new tasks or capabilities, such as processing larger data chunks. Comprehending the potential of the instruction set and its utilization by compilers empowers developers to write code that maximizes resource efficiency. Additionally, it aids developers in deciphering compiler outputs, proving valuable in identifying and rectifying errors.

RISC-V ISA
RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - Five) emerges as an innovative instruction set architecture (ISA) initially designed to foster research and education in computer architecture. The RISC-V ISA comprises a foundational base integer ISA, which is obligatory in all implementations, supplemented by optional extensions that can be integrated with the base ISA. The base integer ISA echoes the principles of early RISC processors while eliminating branch delay slots and incorporating support for variable-length instruction encodings. The core is intentionally confined to a minimal set of instructions, adequate to serve as a practical target for compilers, assemblers, linkers, and operating systems (alongside additional supervisor-level operations). This approach establishes a functional ISA and software toolchain "framework" that can be tailored to create more specialized processor ISAs. The basic integer ISA is denoted as "I" (prefixed by RV32 or RV64, based on integer register width) and encompasses integer computational instructions, integer loads, integer stores, and control-flow instructions, being mandatory for all RISC-V implementations. The standard integer multiplication and division extension is labeled "M" and introduces instructions for multiplying and dividing values stored in integer registers. The standard atomic instruction extension, identified as "A," introduces instructions for atomic memory read-modify-write operations, facilitating inter-processor synchronization. The standard single-precision floating-point extension, referred to as "F," adds single-precision floating-point registers, computational instructions, and data transfer operations. The standard double-precision floating-point extension, termed "D," expands the floating-point register set and introduces double-precision computational instructions and data transfers. An integer base combined with these four standard extensions ("IMAFD") is abbreviated as "G," delivering a versatile scalar instruction set.
