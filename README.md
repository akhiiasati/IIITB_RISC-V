### RISC-V: A Transformative ISA for Innovation

RISC-V, known as "Reduced Instruction Set Computing - Five," is a transformative open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) born from a commitment to advancing computer architecture research and education. With its roots tracing back to the pioneering work of Prof. David Patterson and Prof. John Hennessy, RISC-V redefines chip design, embodying decades of research. It follows a RISC approach, strategically positioning instruction bit fields for simplified CPU design and employing IEEE 754 floating-point precision. Unlike traditional ISAs, RISC-V operates under open-source licenses, offering an edge in flexibility, scalability, and innovation. Led by Prof. Krste AsanoviÄ‡, Yunsup Lee, and Andrew Waterman, its accessible framework empowers ease of processor creation and customization, signifying a new era in instruction set architectures.

### RISC-V Characteristics

- Is a proven ISA and follows established RISC design principles
- Has single-cycle instructions
- Uses a load-store architecture
- Features a simple, stable, software-centric design (small, fixed base with modular fixed-standard extensions)
- Is modular, layered and extensible, allowing for software and hardware freedom on architecture
- Flexible and scalable (i.e., suitable for microcontrollers to personal computers to supercomputers)
- Has 32- and 64-bit variants and extensions to support floating point instructions
- Is supported by various language compilers (e.g., GNU Compiler Collection and Linux operating system)
- Offers a range of hardware support from microcontrollers to systems on module, systems on chip and field programmable gate arrays
- Accelerates the design-to-market timeline through collaboration and open source IP reuse

### RISC-V Foundation and RISC-V International

Established in 2015, the RISC-V Foundation responded to the need for a stable instruction set architecture (ISA) suitable for prolonged commercial use. With a commitment to stability, it took charge of intellectual property related to RISC-V's definition. Among the founding members were innovative entities such as Andes, Google, IBM, SiFive, and even IIT Madras, collectively shaping RISC-V's journey. In 2019, the foundation's transformation into RISC-V International marked its relocation to Switzerland, underlining its commitment to openness and stability. This shift, while maintaining document accessibility, granted member organizations the power to endorse changes and use the trademarked compatibility logo, fostering a collaborative evolution.For more information visit the site : www.riscv.org

### ISA base and extensions

The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is organized into a core "base" instruction set and optional "extensions" that provide additional functionality. This modular design allows for flexibility and customization, enabling different implementations tailored to specific application requirements.

### From Application Software to Hardware Execution: A Flow Overview

When a C program is intended to run on hardware, it goes through several stages. Initially, it's translated into RISC-V assembly language. Then, this assembly language is converted into binary machine language, which the hardware understands. The link between RISC-V assembly language and the chip's physical layout is established using Hardware Description Language (HDL), closely tied to hardware operations.

To define a RISC specification, the architecture is implemented to facilitate data transfer through registers. This involves transitioning from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the chip layout in an RTL to GDSII flow. This ensures applications operate seamlessly on the hardware.

To make an application function on hardware, it navigates the software system, involving the Operating System (OS), compiler, and assembler. The OS manages I/O and memory, the compiler translates high-level code into hardware-specific instructions (like RISC-V for RISC-V systems), and the assembler converts these into binary machine language. This binary, the bridge between C and hardware, follows the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), establishing a link between software and hardware through binary instructions.
